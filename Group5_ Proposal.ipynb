    "Airbnb is one of the most popular booking sites in the world. Hosts will provide a variety of listings on the website, and customers can also choose what they want according to their own preferences. Aribnb prices are usually determined by the hosts empirically. However, it ends up causing the challenge for the hosts. How do new hosts ensure rents are high enough to make money and customers are willing to place orders? For customers, in addition to renting a house they like, they want to ensure that the rent is reasonable and valuable. Besides, Airbnb prices are not fixed but fluctuate so customers also want to determine whether now is the good timing for booking the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers on Airbnb always suffer from the prices that hosts set up and customers browse. Both of them want to know what kind of prices are rational and attractive to each other. Thus, using learned-based models such as machine learning and deep learning to predict price is completely beneficial and valuable for both hosts and customers. Group 5 is trying to figure out what kind of learning methods and data manipulation skills are useful for predicting rental prices. Also, we would use r-square to determine the performance of model  "

    "In the first literature, the author developed two classifiers, one is to predict the range in which a listing's price falls, and the other is to predict the listing's neighborhood. Based on airbnb data, we find a lot of 'nominal scale' features such as \"neighborhood\" and \"room type\". Those features are not like interval or ratio features which can be manipulated relatively easier. So the author input the features listed above into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, implemented using sklearnâ€™s SVM package, and discreted listing prices into two buckets seperated at the median. Manipulating nominal scale features(data) might also be significant in data processing  "

    "Then, we learn the knowledge from second paper is that the linear regression can obtain the moderate model based on r-square criteria; however, the model build up by XGBoost and  neural network out-perform other approaches like machine learning. Thus, we would try to use neural network for transfer learning to train our model."

    "In the last one, the author also utilized XGBoost and neural network to train the model, and use the mean square error and r-square to evaluate the performance. Besides, the author also listed the top 5 important features and bottom 5 important features. After strengthening the top 5 features and eliminating bottom 5 features, the performance of model is better. Therefore we would very look forward to observe what kind of features are more critical in the chicago dataset."
